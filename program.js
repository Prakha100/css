/*1. Write a program that loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
*/

for (let line = "#"; line.length < 8; line += "#")
  console.log(line);


2. Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, 
using newline characters to separate lines. 
At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. 
The characters should form a chessboard.
